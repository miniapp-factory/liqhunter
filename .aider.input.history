+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A tool that estimates potential "Liquidation Heatmaps" based on Open Interest data.
+User Goal: Predict where price might bounce due to forced liquidations of over-leveraged traders.
+Core Features (MVP):
+
+* Visualize "clusters" of potential long/short liquidations.
+* Logic based on: Entry Price + Leverage assumptions (e.g., 25x, 50x, 100x).
+* Real-time price overlay on the heatmap.
+
+Development Plan:
+
+1. Fetch Open Interest and recent large trade data.
+2. Create a simplified algorithm: "If 10MLongsenteredat50k, they liquidate at $X".
+3. Visualize this as a horizontal bar chart or bubble chart at price levels.
+4. Update in near real-time.
+5. Note: Accurate liquidation data is hard to get; this would be an estimator tool.
