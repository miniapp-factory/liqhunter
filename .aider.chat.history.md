```
Idea: A tool that estimates potential "Liquidation Heatmaps" based on Open Interest data.
User Goal: Predict where price might bounce due to forced liquidations of over-leveraged traders.
Core Features (MVP):

* Visualize "clusters" of potential long/short liquidations.
* Logic based on: Entry Price + Leverage assumptions (e.g., 25x, 50x, 100x).
* Real-time price overlay on the heatmap.

Development Plan:

1. Fetch Open Interest and recent large trade data.
2. Create a simplified algorithm: "If 10MLongsenteredat50k, they liquidate at $X".
3. Visualize this as a horizontal bar chart or bubble chart at price levels.
4. Update in near real-time.
5. Note: Accurate liquidation data is hard to get; this would be an estimator tool.

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update the logo‑generation instruction file.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
